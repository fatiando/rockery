MEAN
====

The MEAN Earth model is a variant of the IASP91 Earth model. MEAN [Marone2004]_ is a
one-dimensional earth model representing average Earth properties as a function of Earth radius.
This model has parameters for radius, density, P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, and attenuation
(Q).It's available through IRIS Data Services Products [IRIS2011]_ in a nc file (netCDF). The data
is loaded into :class:`pandas.DataFrame` objects.
