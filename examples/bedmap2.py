Bedmap2
=======

Bedmap2 is a suite of gridded products describing surface elevation,
ice-thickness, the sea floor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic
south of 60Â°S [BEDMAP2]_. Each dataset is projected in Antarctic Polar
Stereographic projection, latitude of true scale -71 degrees south, datum
WGS84. All heights are in metres relative to sea level as defined by the g104c
geoid. The datasets are downloaded as ``tiff`` files and loaded into
a :class:`xarray.Dataset` object.
