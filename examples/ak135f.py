ak135-f
=======

The ak135-f Earth model [Kennett1995]_ is a variant of the ak135 Earth model
with the density and Q model from [Montagner1996]_ added.
The ak135-f Earth model is a one-dimensional model representing average Earth properties as a
function of depth. The model includes the depth, density, seismic velocities and attenuation (Q)
on the boundaries of several Earth layers. It's available through IRIS Data Services Products
[IRIS2011]_ in a csv file (comma-separated values). The data is loaded into
:class:`pandas.DataFrame` objects.
