PEM-A: Average Parametric Earth Model
=====================================

The PEM-A Earth model [Dziewonsky1975]_ is a weighted average of both the
PEM-O Earth model and the PEM-C Earth model. It is a one-dimensional model
representing average Earth properties as a function of depth. The model
includes the radius, depth, density, P-wave velocity, and S-wave velocity on the boundaries of
several Earth layers. It's available through IRIS Data Services Products [IRIS2011]_
in a csv file (comma-separated values). The data is loaded into
:class:`pandas.DataFrame` objects.
