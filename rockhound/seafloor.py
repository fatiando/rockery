        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            Full path of the compressed file in local storage.
        action : str
            Indicates what action was taken by :meth:`pooch.Pooch.fetch`. One of:

    Fetch the age of the oceanic lithosphere global grid

    Grids produced by [Muller2008]_.

    Includes the age uncertainty grid as well. Both are available in 2 and 6 arc-minute
    resolutions. The units for the ages are millions of years. The grids span longitudes
    from 0 E to 360 E and latitudes from 90 N to -90 N and are grid-line registered.

    If the files aren't already in your data directory, they will be downloaded
    automatically.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution : str
        Which resolution grid to load. Must be ``"6min"`` or ``"2min"``.
    load : bool
        Wether to load the data into an :class:`xarray.Dataset` or just return the
        path to the downloaded data. If False, will return a list with the paths to the
        age and age uncertainty grids, respectively.
    kwargs
        Keyword arguments will be forwarded to the :func:`xarray.open_dataset` function
